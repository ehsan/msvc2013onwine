This script helps you set up an MSVC 2013 Update 4 installation on Linux to run under wine.

Instructions
============

Before you start, make sure you have a Windows machine with a working Python environment (I have used the Python that comes with MozillaBuild) with lots of free disk space.

On the Windows machine, first download and install Visual C++ 2013 Community Edition from http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2013-community-vs.aspx. Then, run `python package_from_installed.py`.  It will take a while, and once it finishes successfully, there should be a <sha1>.zip file in the current working directory.  That is your Visual C++ installation, packaged and ready to be transfered into a Linux machine.

On the Linux machine, extract the ZIP package somewhere.  Then, you can run MSVC like this:

$ cd /path/to/win_toolchain_2013
$ export INCLUDE="$PWD/VC/include;$PWD/win8sdk/Include/shared/;$PWD/win8sdk/Include/um/;$PWD/win8sdk/Include/winrt/"
$ export LIB="$PWD/VC/lib;$PWD/win8sdk/Lib/winv6.3/um/x86"
$ echo "#include <iostream>" > test.cpp
$ echo "int main() { std::cout << \"Hello from MSVC\\n\"; }" >> test.cpp
$ export WINEDEBUG=-all # to turn off wine's warnings about unimplemented stuff
$ cp sys32/msvcr120.dll VC/bin # need the native version of this DLL
$ export export WINEDLLOVERRIDES="*msvcr120=n" # tell wine to use the native DLL
$ wine VC/bin/cl.exe test.cpp
